## Spring Pizzeria Web Api
output:

Project developed using Java Spring Boot to manage pizzas, ingredients, reviews, and special offers with full CRUD operations. It follows the MVC architecture and uses Spring Data JPA with One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships for efficient data management. The UI is built with Thymeleaf, using modular fragments for maintainability. Advanced filtering allows searches by name, ingredients, and dietary preferences (gluten-free, vegetarian, halal). The application includes a services layer to handle business logic separately from controllers and provides REST API controllers for external interaction. Data is pre-populated using seeder classes with DataFaker, and the project is managed with Maven üõ∞Ô∏è.
